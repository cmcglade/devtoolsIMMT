<!-- watch your spelling, typo in the html tag. A somewhat odd use of the br tag, or the meta description tag.  also try to make sure your indents are the same for tags, in other words the closing ul tag should be indented the same as the opening one, also it would be better to use the h2 tag on "A Few Things About Me" rather than on a sentence. Close your image tag! 5 out of 10-->
