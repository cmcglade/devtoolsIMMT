<!-- good formatting in the image tag.  You could have included a little more content so the br tag would have made more sense, no real need to use it after the ul tags.  using ul and li for only one item is a bit non traditional; normally a list is only a list because it is more than one item.  missing the meta description tag, and you linked to the wrong image filename, but it is a great picture!  the title of the page should be About Me, and the filename should be the assignment and your name 6.5 out of 10 -->
