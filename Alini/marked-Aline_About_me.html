<!-- your p tags are a ;ittle mixed up, you have not closed the first one before you opened the second one.  we don't normally "nest" p tags inside each other.  No need to use a br tag before an h2 tag. overall a good job!  try to clean up image filenames if you can, there is a repeated jpg. Make sure you say what doctype it is! should be doctype html. 8 out of 10-->

<h1>
	Hello, my name is Aline
</h1>

<p>
	I just turned 29 years old, just moved to Toronto, in Canada, and just started a graduate certificate in Interactive Media Mannagement, at Centennial College. I can say that I am having a fresh start this Fall 2015.
	I am brazillian, have a bachelor in Journalism, from Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, and a certificate in Marketing, from UCLA. I worked in two big newspapers in Brazil and in a fashion e-commerce start-up in Los Angeles, where I lived for the last two and a half years.
	
	<br>Now I am getting ready to take my career to another level and becoming a digital strategist. But my road is open. And, since my classes started, I have been getting in touch with so many new trends and concepts, that my path might change in the course of this year. 
	
	<br>For now, this is my first webpage, with content and coding written by me and I am proud of that.
