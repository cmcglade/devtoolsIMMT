             <p> I came to Canada in 2003 after many happy years in Mexico running the family business. 
             The drug cartel industry is one of the most the successful in the world and I was sent to Canada to grow sales and increase market share.  This was a very important initiative because we knew that Canadians were looking for a way to escape their problems and find looking true happiness - something that Mexicans had already because of tequila.
             </p><br>
             <p>Unfortunately, it turned out that Canadians were growing their own supply of marijuana which was better than what Mexico had to offer.  I was forced to resign from my duties and live a normal life.  In the process of exploring the Canadian drug world I fell in love with a beautiful Canadian woman and settled in Canada as a new resident.</P><br>
             <h4>What my family in Mexico thought about that:</h4>
             <ul>
                 <li>who is this girl?</li>
                 <li>is it always cold in Canada?</li>
                 <li>why is he washing dishes for $6 dollar an hour?</li>
                 <li>do they have penguins as pets?</li>
                 <li>if it is so cold, how come they can grow marijuana?</li>
             </ul>

             <p>In the end, I learned that stereotypes can be misleading and so I have decided to to avoid them.
