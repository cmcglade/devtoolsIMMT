    <p><strong>Tyrannosaurus</strong>("tyrant lizard", from the Ancient Greek tyrannos,
     "tyrant", and sauros, "lizard") is a genus of coelurosaurian theropod dinosaur.
      The species Tyrannosaurus rex (rex meaning "king" in Latin), commonly abbreviated
       to T. rex, is one of the most well-represented of the large theropods.</p>

    <p>Like other tyrannosaurids, Tyrannosaurus was a bipedal carnivore
     with a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. Relative to its large and powerful
      hind limbs, Tyrannosaurus fore limbs were short but unusually powerful for their size 
      and had two clawed digits.</p>
      
     <p> Although other theropods rivaled or exceeded Tyrannosaurus rex in size,
        it was the largest known tyrannosaurid and one of the largest known land predators.
         In fact, the most complete specimen measures up to 12.3 m (40 ft) in length</p>
